# Graham Sans - an example font repository

This repository is designed to show how I typically organise a font project. There's not much here at the moment, but the plan is to adopt the Unified Font Repository standard - see https://github.com/raphaelbastide/Unified-Font-Repository/
## The font

Graham Sans is a font I released as freeware way back in 2005. I look back on it now and cringe, but hey - it may be of use to someone as a starting point for a typeface that's actually good.

It comes in two weights, Regular and Bold, and the only changes I've made are to combine the single weights into one Fontlab 7 file and make the contours interpolatable.
